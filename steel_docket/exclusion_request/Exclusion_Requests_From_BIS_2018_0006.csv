BESTAR LLC,7228304000,United States,U.S. Service Center,7000,No U.S. steel mill has the capability to produce chipper knife steel with these dimensions.
"California Steel Industries, Inc.",7224900055,United States,Other (Explain in Comment Box),100000000,"Following immense changes in the steel industry over the past three decades, it has become impossible to buy slab from domestic mills, which are simply not in the business of making slabs for sale to other steel companies on any regular basis. Slabs are used exclusively by steel rolling mills in sheet and plate production. Fairly traded slab imports are especially important to the Western U. S. sheet and plate market, where no producers of semi-finished steel products are located. As need for slab in particular size combinations varies based on customer orders for finished steel products, the exclusion request is based on the company's best estimate of maximum possible requirement to meet customer needs."
Greenfield Industries,7228100010,United States,Manufacturer,76.00173826217652,"This is a niche material.  Domestic producers of high speed steel only have enough capacity to supply 20-25% of the specific steel needed for the US Cutting Tool Industry.  It is estimated that it would take 3-5 years for the US producers to build and install the specific equipment needed to increase capacity, assuming that they are even willing to invest in this small market with low margin products.  Several of our competitors have left the US or have always manufactured outside the US are not subject to the 25% tariff.  These competitors invest outside the US, use foreign manufactured steel, foreign vendors, and foreign labor, giving them a competitive advantage in the market place.  All quantities listed below are assumed to be annual where applicable.  "
Griggs Steel Company,7225401110,United States,U.S. Service Center,3000,The US does not have adequate capacity to produce finished high speed steel plate to meet the market's needs.
"Hitachi Metal America, Ltd.",7223009000,United States,Manufacturer,47998,The domestic industry cannot manufacture high-quality drawn wire piston rings necessary for the current domestic automotive demand. 
Magellan Corporation,7228505070,United States,U.S.-Distributor,60000,"There are two U.S. mills that have the ability to produce this item, but their production is limited. "
"Mid-Continent Spring Co., Inc.",7229905051,United States,Manufacturer,40000,There is no source for this material in the USA. 
"National Oilwell Varco, L.P.",7225307000,United States,Manufacturer,39291,Surface quality of Hot Rolled steel coils supplied by domestic steel producers has proven to be inadequate for manufacturing coiled tubing because the finished products contain excessive and dangerous defects.
Shinsho American Corporation,7229909000,United States,U.S.-Distributor,88400,"Not available in the US that meets our customer's quality requirements for taper roller bearing productions.
Material requires extremely low non-metallic inclusion, cleanness and strict surface condition. This is indispensable for safety critical automotive parts."
Swagelok Company,7222110059,United States,Manufacturer,15721.67,"Swagelok uses both U.S.-made and non-U.S. steel in its products.  Swagelok’s current U.S. steel suppliers cannot and (over the next few years if ever) could not replace all of the steel supplied by Swagelok’s EU suppliers.  To the extent Swagelok could replace a portion of its non-US steel supply, the certification and qualification of another U.S. producer (even if this were possible) to replace the product from our current supply chains would result in a significant and detrimental delay to our operations.  It is critical to our supply chain and our business that we continue to be able to purchase a portion of these stainless steel products from EU producers."
voestalpine Rotec Inc. ,7306305015,Austria,Manufacturer,53000,"The product has been developed together with our customer and our supplier and has been validated from Chrysler automotive. It is produced according to ASTM A513/5 SAE 1020 NA with very tight outside and inside tolerances.  We went through a long approval process together with our customer as well as with Chrysler which included extensive product testing and we are locked in for the entire product life cycle. This product is critical to remove vibration from an automobile and helps to keep the passangers safe, increases the life cycle of the automotive and increases the comfort of the passengers."
