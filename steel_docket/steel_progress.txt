in dict['attachments'] which is a list

for i in dict['attachments']
	url = dict['attachments'][i]['fileFormats']['0']
	#in the string there is 'contentType=pdf'
	#or 'contentType=excel12book'

TAKES FOREVER WHEN SUBMITTED PDFS HAVE GRAPHS IN THEM AND CONVERT THEM TO TEXT

NEXT STEPS:
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DOWNLOAD THEM ALL TO ONE FOLDER
WRITE SCRIPT TO GO THROUGH ALL FILES IN THAT FOLDER AND ADD THEM TO A CSV
	PROBLEM IS ALIGNING COMPANY PDFS, EXCLUSION REQUESTS, AND OBJECTIONS

1. Group CSV files by which type they are in a folder
	1.a. write a different script (same basic thing) for each different CSV files
	1.b. will have to figure out what to do about pdf's unsure best route as of now

2. Figure out how to open every single file in a folder
	2.b.
